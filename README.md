# Beginner Project in Python: Countdown Timer
Problem Statement:
Timers are essential tools for task tracking, productivity, and everyday reminders. In this project, you are required to build a Countdown Timer Application in Python that not only accepts a time duration in seconds from the user but also includes interactive control options such as Pause, Resume, and Cancel during the countdown. The timer must display the remaining time in a mm:ss format dynamically on the screen. Upon completion or cancellation, the appropriate message should be displayed.

This project will strengthen your grasp on control flow, time management, user interaction, and function structuring in Python.
